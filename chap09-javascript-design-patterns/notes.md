# Learning JavaScript Design Patterns

## Chapter 9. JavaScript Design Patterns

### Singleton Pattern

#### Applicability

> * There must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point.
> * When the sole instance should be extensible by sub-classing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code.

### Mediator Pattern

> It is an object that handles the workflow between many other objects, aggregating the responsibility of that workflow knowledge into a single object

### Command Pattern

> It facilitates the execution of commands between an Invoker and a Receiver by encapsulating the implementation details on a method instead of calling the instance's methods that may change in the future.

#### Abstract Class

> An Abstract Class provides an Interface but it doesn't have instances. It acts as a base class from which others are derived.

#### Concrete Class

> A Concrete Class is a derived class which implements the missing functionality of an Abstract class.
