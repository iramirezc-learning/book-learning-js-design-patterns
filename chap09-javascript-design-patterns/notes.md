# Learning JavaScript Design Patterns

## Chapter 9. JavaScript Design Patterns

### Singleton Pattern

#### Applicability

> * There must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point.
> * When the sole instance should be extensible by sub-classing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code.

### Mediator Pattern

> It is an object that handles the workflow between many other objects, aggregating the responsibility of that workflow knowledge into a single object.
